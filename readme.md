# mate Website
 This website is for the spoken-word artist/ songwriter eddie brett's project called 'mate' (He doesn't use capital letters in his names.) Its a one-stop-shop for anyone wanting information on him and what he is up to or how to get in touch if they so wish.
 
## UX

Visiting this website the users wants to know what mate is, whos behind it, what its about and how to get involved.
- I want it to be clean, clear, quick, easy and stylistically project mates brand identity.
//////////include wireframes here.///////

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
 In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
 This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
 ## Features
 In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...
 For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.
 In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
 ### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea
 ## Technologies Used
 In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
 - [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
 ## Testing
 In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
 Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
 For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
 1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
 In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
 You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
 If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
 ## Deployment
 This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
 In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?
 In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

Eddie Brett

We are creating a website for the London street poet Eddie Brett. The site wants to be simple, clean and appealing to a 17-28 demographic. He is starting a new project and this website is acting as a transitional piece until more material and information is available. He wants visitors to know who he is, what he has done, what he is doing and how to get in touch. The website should appear professional without being overly formal. It needs to feel inviting, unique and slightly quirky to compliment Eddie’s personallity and work.

From looking at Eddie’s social media activity and artwork i can see that he likes pastel colours, ‘poppin’s’ font and using lowercase text. With this in mind i've included all three things in the site. I've kept layout elements consistent and uniformed throughout the site in order to give each visitor a sense or calm and ease in order to give them a positive quick experience on the site. I've placed a few subtle punk inspired features e.g. typewriter font hover, inverted negative photograph effect on the social hover icons, i've given text white borders to look like labelling and i've put text both to the left and right to give the user a sense of mystery from the norm. Hopefully these little quirks give personallity to the site and give it a unique feel cosidering how simplistic and uniformed it is. I wanted the music page to splatter across the page like a sporadic collage, i have achieved this to some degree however at the moment it looks fairly regimented and i think i'll spend some more time on this in the future to create a bespoke layout.

The music industry is going through a big resergence of DIY artists and so i didnt want to use anything too fancy or complex and have kept everything matter of fact. Only including information that is neccesary. 

Eventually i'll add an online shop to the site aswell as various blogs/ new release information and touring information.

My design reference points were lifestyle fashions brands such as; adidas and supreme. I also looked at poets, musicians and rappers such as George the poet, Rizzle Kickz, Tyler the creator/ odd future, George Ezra, Mac Demarco and Al the Native to give me a sense of what was happening, what works, what doesn't and how to avoid being a copycat.

I've used bootstrap, HTML5, CSS and google fonts within this project.

I have tested it out of different devices with different size requirements and am confident across the board.


deployement
everytime that i make a change on my website i deploy the update to github. I only have one branch on my website called the master so everything is updated there.
setting github repo turn it on.
