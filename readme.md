# mate Website

We are creating a website for the London street poet Eddie Brett and his latest project entitled 'mate'. The site wants to be simple, clean, easy to navigate and appealing to a 17-28 demographic. This is a new project so although information is sparse at the moment the site will grow and expand as the project does incorparating new information and material as it becomes available. He wants visitors to know who he is, what he has done, what he is doing and how to get in touch. The website should appear professional without being overly formal. It needs to feel inviting, unique and slightly quirky to compliment Eddie’s personallity and work.
 
## UX

Visiting this website the users should quickly be made aware of what mate is, who's behind it, what it's about and how to get involved.
I want it to be clean, clear, quick, easy and stylistically project mates brand identity; quirky, individual, positive, balanced, intelligent, inclusive, fun.

### Consistant features
I want the website to feel instantly familiarly, calm and easy to navigate and so in order to achieve this i implemented consistant features throughout the page that tie-in with 'mates' brand identity:
From looking at Eddie’s social media activity and artwork i can see that he likes pastel colours, ‘poppin’s’ font and using lowercase text and so i was sure to include these aspects in the site. Some consistent features you'll notice are:
        - pastel blue background throughout
        - navigation bar same place/front throughout- when hovered font changes to type-write giving the user a pleasurable experience and a nod to a punk font whilst remaining clean and understandable.
        - footer is the same throughout othering the visitors easy access to his social platforms. When hovered the colors are inverted like an x-ray scanner, again another off the wall suitle feature to strike the user. 
        - I have given text a white background border to emulate newspaper cuttings to fit the style of early punk art.
        - The 'mate' logo proudly stays in the top left corner to offer the user a clear and comforting understanding of where they are and what this is all about.
### Existing Features
The home page is the first page that visitor will see and so i have place a recognisable picture used as the artwork for his first release. I have tried to make the text included thorough and informative whilst remaining entertaining and necessary. I was cautious to not waffle on, repeat anything and become boring. Anyone wanting to know who mate is will find out here.

I wanted the music page to feel like a collage. A varied mixture of the different things that Eddie has worked on. This page can easily grow and adapt as more work becomes available. Users wanting to see material are presented with various music and video options.

The merch page is more-or-less a blank page at the moment. It exists to let people know that there will be merchandise avaiable soon so to keep checking. 

The collab page is very matter of fact. Not busy with infomation just a very clear box and oportunity for users to connect with the project if they want. Users wanting to contact mate can do so here and i have attached the managers email to the email-box.

 ### Features Left to Implement
 As 'mate' / Eddie's body of work grows we will design and create a bespoke template for displaying his work on the 'music' page. Things will overlap each other and display when hovered- a virtual version of a handmade collage however this will be quite complex to implement and not necessary at the moment.
 
 Once merchandise is available and there is interest from fans to buy we will incorparate an eCommerce section to our merch page using shopify: www.shopify.co.uk/ . We will show pictures of the items and include clickable anchors to complete the transaction.
 
 Once the project is in full swing and mate is touring we will also create a new page called 'touring' a gig type poster designed in photoshop to relay all of the information regarding gig dates and upcoming shows.


 ## Technologies Used
I've used the bootstrap framework https://getbootstrap.com/ because of its ease of use and clear layouts.
I have used google fonts https://fonts.google.com/ to give my site some interesting asthetically pleasing fonts that tie in well with the brand.
I have embedded youtube iFrames in my site because they are a fantastic video player and the format is known to the user degraphic.
I have made my site with HTML5 and CSS.
I have used a custom domaine name purchased from Go daddy. www.godaddy.com

 ## Testing
  I tested the code using the mark up validation website https://validator.w3.org/ and addressed any errors it picked up.
  I used the google chrome inspect tool to check the functionality on various devices. 
  I got friends to test the site on their devices in order to get some honest feedback on the ease of use and to pick up any problems i had over looked.
  I clicked on every hyperlink to ensure that i arrived at the correct destination.
  I clicked play on all of the videos to make sure they played and that they displayed the correct content.
  
Using mobile first design was a great way to ensure that the site was asthetically pleasing across all devices.

I sent test emails to the email address provided in the contact page to ensure that that feature was working.

 ## Deployment
 When i have made a change to my website i deploy the update to GitHub. This website is simple in nature and so only requires one branch called the master and everything is uploaded there.
 When i have made a change that i want to upload i type in the terminal:
 'git init' 
 Then i add the file i have updated for exaple:
 'git add readme.md'
 I then add a note of what has been updated and commit the files staged in the local repository:
 'git commit -m "updated readme file to be more specific and include UX drawings"'
 and then finally: 
 'git push -u origin master' This pushes the changes in the local repository to github.

 ### Acknowledgements
My design reference points were lifestyle fashions brands such as; adidas and supreme. I also looked at poets, musicians and rappers such as Ratboy, George the poet, Rizzle Kickz, Tyler the creator/ odd future, George Ezra, Mac Demarco and Al the Native to give me a sense of what was happening, what works, what doesn't and how to avoid being a copycat.
